Download and decompress it, and move into the new directory, where you will find: (1) a file called `compi.parameters`, which contains the pipeline parameters where you should update the `working_dir` parameter so that it points to to the path where you have the decompressed data; and (2) a file called `run.sh`, which provides a script to run the pipeline (`./run.sh /path/to/working_dir/compi.parameters).
